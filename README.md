By: Thailer Simmons, Juan Zanguitu, Yingqi Jiang, Hrideta Rimu​
## PROJECT OBJECTIVE​
Our goal is to develop a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, or Normal X-ray images.​
## BACKGROUND ​
COVID-19 diagnosis is often based on RT-PCR tests, which can be slow and requires intensive resources. Chest X-rays provide a faster, more accessible screening method. ​

### Dataset is collected from Kaggle:​
Total images: 1,823.​
Classes: COVID-19 (536), Viral Pneumonia (619), Normal (668).​ Image types: JPEG, PNG, JFIF, Other.​
